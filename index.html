  <p>
    I'm a master communicator...therefore, I like to talk...a lot. After being born and raised in Central Florida, I moved to Savannah, Georgia, where I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Advertising from Savannah College of Art and Design, and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science in Public Relations from Georgia Southern University. Despite my love for fried green tomatoes and Southern hospitality, I returned to Central Florida in 2015.

    With experience in communications, focusing particularly on advertising campaigns and graphic design, I'm building my skillset to include web development.
